            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Pear Rafters began as a small dream shared by a group of friends who spent their weekends chasing
            rivers and learning their moods. What started with a single raft and a deep respect for the water
            slowly grew as word spread about their skill, safety, and unmatched river knowledge. Locals began to
            trust them, travelers followed, and the river became more than a playground—it became a calling</p>
